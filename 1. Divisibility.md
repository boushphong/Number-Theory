# Divisibility
## Greatest Common Divisor
### Introduction to Divisibility
- We say integer `a ≠ 0` divides integer `b` if and only if there exists an integer `m` such that `a × m = b`.
- We say `a` is a divisor or `a` factor of `b`. This is equivalent to saying that `b` is a multiple of `a`.
- **Note:** We denote `a` divides `b` by `a | b`.

**Examples:**
Is 5 a divisor of 100?
- 5 | 100, we say 5 is a divisor (or factor) of 100 or 100 is a multiple of 5 because 5 × 20 = 100.

What are the divisors of 21? 
- 1, −1, 3, −3, 7, −7, 21, and −21 are divisors of 21.

What are the divisors of -1?
- The divisors of −21 are the same as the divisors of 21.


#### Theorem: Properties of Divisors
- `a | 1` then `a = ± 1`
- If `a | b` and `b | c` then `a | c`
- If `a | b` and `c | d` then `(a × c) | (b × d)`
- `a | b` and `b | a` then `a = ± b`
- If `a | b` and `b ≠ 0` then `|a| ≤ |b|`

### Linear Combination
#### Theorem: Linear Combination 
- If `a | b` and `a | c` then `a | (bx + cy)` for any integers `x` and `y`

### Greatest Common Divisor
```python
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        # print("a:", a, "b:", b)
    return a

print(gcd(15, 35))
"""
a: 35 b: 15
a: 15 b: 5
a: 5 b: 0
5
"""
```
Let us consider two integers, 15 and 35. The divisors of these numbers are:
- 1, 3, 5, and 15 are the positive divisors of 15.
- 1, 5, 7, and 35 are the positive divisors of 35.

Hence, the GCD of 15 and 35 is 5.

#### Proposition
- If `gcd(a, b) = g`, then `gcd(a / g, b / g) = 1`

**Examples:**

```python
a = 36
b = 60
print(gcd(a, b))  # Output: 12

print(gcd(36 / 12, 60 / 12))  # Output: 1
```
